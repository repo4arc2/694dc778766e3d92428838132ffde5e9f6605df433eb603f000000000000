-Androids, aliens, and wizards.

156
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,125
-That's not a thing.
-That's definitely a thing.

157

No, it's not.

158
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,333
Every time we fight,
it's one of the three.

-Who are you fighting now, Gandalf?
-How do you know about Gandalf?

160
00:09:49,417 --> 00:09:53,125
I read <i>The Hobbit</i>
in 1937 when it first came out.

161
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:56,708
-So you see my point?
-No, I don't. There are no wizards.

162
00:09:56,792 --> 00:09:58,292
-Doctor Strange.
-Is a sorcerer.

Aah! (CHUCKLES)

164

A sorcerer is a wizard without a hat.

165
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,250
Think about it. Right?

166
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,708
I'm right.
I just came up with that. It's crazy.

167
00:10:07,792 --> 00:10:10,500
But that's not the point.
These guys aren't magical.

00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,208
Great. So no plan.

-No, you can't call me that.

Why not? That's what Steve called you.

178

Great.

Where's the chute?

185
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,625
We're at 200 feet.
It's too low for a chute.

-Hmm.

00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,500
(CHUCKLES) Sorry.
It's not exactly hacking.

311
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,917
It's government property.

312
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,542
Kind of the government. (CHUCKLES)

313
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:00,792
Does he always just stare like that?

314
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:03,417
You get used to it.

315
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,125
Okay, look, (CLEARS THROAT) you know,
things have gotten kind of, uh...

316
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,208
Chaotic.

317
00:21:08,292 --> 00:21:10,000
Yeah. The GRC,
they're doing the best they can

318
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,167
to get things up
and running smoothly, post Blip.

319
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,625
LEMAR: Reactivating citizenship,
social security, healthcare.

320
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,083
Basically just managing resources

321
00:21:17,167 --> 00:21:19,292
for the refugees
who were displaced by the return.

322
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:22,042
The Global Repatriation Council
does all that. I get that.

323
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,792
So why exactly are you two here?

324
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:26,625
Well, they provide the resources
and we keep things stable.

325
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:29,792
Yeah, violent revolutionaries
aren't usually good for anyone's cause.

326
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:32,500
Usually said by the people
with the resources.

327
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,125
CAPTAIN AMERICA:
We got a lot of resources.

328
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,417
If you guys, if you joined up
with us, we could...

329
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,458
-No.
-I got mad respect for both of y'all.

330
00:21:38,542 --> 00:21:40,958
But you were getting
your asses kicked till we showed up.

331
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,708
-Who are you?
-Lemar Hoskins.

332
00:21:43,792 --> 00:21:46,542
Look, I see a guy hanging out
of a helicopter in tactical gear,

333
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,292
I need a lot more than Lemar Hoskins.

334
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,333
I'm Battlestar. John's partner.

335
00:21:50,417 --> 00:21:51,583
"Battlestar"?

336
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,917
Stop the car!

337
00:21:56,667 --> 00:21:59,542
CAPTAIN AMERICA:
Look, I... I get it, okay?

338
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,333
I get the attitude, I do.

339
00:22:01,417 --> 00:22:04,292
You didn't think that the shield
was gonna end up here.

340
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:05,542
I get it, Bucky.

341
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:10,333
And I'm... I'm not trying to be Steve.

342
00:22:10,417 --> 00:22:12,042
I'm not trying to replace Steve.

343
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:17,167
I'm just trying to be
the best Captain America I can be.

344
00:22:18,167 --> 00:22:19,167
That's it.

345
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,583
It'd be a whole lot easier
if I had Cap's wingmen on my side.

346
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:24,750
(SCOFFS)

347
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:26,833
It's always that last line.

348
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,083
CAPTAIN AMERICA: Let's go.

349

352
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:19,500
-Very hungry.
-SOLDIERS: Yeah.

353
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:22,292
-SOLDIER: Yeah, we are hungry.
-Okay. My wife and I cooked.

354
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:26,083
It's an old family recipe
made with the finest chicken livers.

355
00:23:26,167 --> 00:23:27,750
Please serve yourselves.

-Anything you want. Anything. You ask me.
-KARLI: Um...

357
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:33,542
There is some coffee here
and some crackers.

358
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:36,583
-KARLI: We're okay. Thank you.
-Uh, anything we can do for the cause.

359
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:37,875
Please follow me.

360
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,000
You're becoming a bit of a legend.

361
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:45,167
I hear more and more people talk about
the freedom fighters who are pushing back.

362
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,542
They call you Robin Hood.

363
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:51,458
Every day more people love you.

364
00:23:51,542 --> 00:23:53,792
You'll find refuge wherever you go.

365
00:23:57,458 --> 00:24:00,000
My wife and I made this just for you.

366
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:01,667
Everything is completely clean.

367

I'm wiping our aliases
off any public traffic sites now.

378
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,625
LENNOX: Karli.
We can't stay here for long.

379
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:37,458
Six months ago would you have imagined
people supporting the cause like this?

380
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:39,042
We're not playing no more.

381
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:41,250
We can't let these assholes

382
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:43,292
who were put back
in power after The Blip win.

383
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:46,667
The GRC care more about the people

384
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,958
who came back
than the ones who never left.

385
00:24:49,042 --> 00:24:50,917
We got a glimpse of how things could be.

386
00:24:52,917 --> 00:24:55,000
I need to know that you're all committed,

387
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:57,375
because after tomorrow,
there's no going back.

00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:05,750
Yeah. One world.

389
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:06,833

00:25:06,917 --> 00:25:08,583
MATIAS: One world.
SOLDIERS: One people.

391
00:25:08,667 --> 00:25:10,625
-One world!
-SOLDIERS: One people!

392
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:19,500
SAM: You all right?

393
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:25,167
Let's take the shield, Sam.

394
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:28,625
Let's take the shield
and do this ourselves.

395
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,083
We can't just run up on the man,
beat him up, and take it.

396
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:37,500
Do you remember
what happened the last time we stole it?

397
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:39,958
-Maybe.
-I'll help you in case you forgot.

398
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,625
Sharon was branded enemy of the state,

399
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:46,375
and Steve and I were
on the run for two years.

400
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:48,500
I don't know about you,

401
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:51,583
but I don't wanna live
the rest of my life <i>la vida loca.</i>

402
00:25:52,542 --> 00:25:57,083
We just got our ass handed to us
by Super Soldiers, and we got nothing.

403
00:25:58,375 --> 00:25:59,792
Not entirely true.

404
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:21,083
There is someone that you should meet.

405
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:40,375
KID: Hey, it's Black Falcon. What's up?
SAM: It's just Falcon, kid.

406
00:26:41,417 --> 00:26:45,083
No, no.
My daddy told me it's Black Falcon.

407
00:26:45,875 --> 00:26:48,500
Is it because
I'm Black and I'm the Falcon?

408
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:51,333
Well, technically, I mean, yes.

409
00:26:51,417 --> 00:26:53,708
So are you, like, Black kid?

410
00:26:53,792 --> 00:26:54,833
(SIGHS)

411
00:26:54,917 --> 00:26:57,000
(CHUCKLES) I got him, right?

412
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:58,250
Whatever, man.

413
00:26:59,167 --> 00:27:00,875
(CHUCKLES) Whatever.

414
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,167
We're here to see Isaiah.

415
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:24,125
Nobody named Isaiah live here.

416
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:28,500
Look, we just want to talk to him.

417
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:30,500
You must not hear what I just said.

418
00:27:32,042 --> 00:27:33,667
You ain't getting in this house.

419
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:35,583
Y'all can leave now.

420
00:27:38,458 --> 00:27:41,125
Tell him the guy
from the bar in Goyang is here.

421
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:43,708
He's gonna know what that means.

422
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:49,167
All right, wait here.

423
00:27:53,792 --> 00:27:56,375
Nice kid. How do you know this guy?

424
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,542
I used to.

425
00:27:58,625 --> 00:28:00,417
We had a skirmish
during the Korean War.

426
00:28:06,167 --> 00:28:07,625
BOY: Today's your lucky day.

427
00:28:08,583 --> 00:28:10,458
He said he wanna see for himself.

00:28:17,167 --> 00:28:18,417
Isaiah?

430
00:28:19,208 --> 00:28:20,417
Look at you.

431
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:27,792
This is, uh, Sam. Sam, this is Isaiah.

432
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:29,208
He was a hero.

433
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,833
One of the ones that HYDRA
feared the most. Like Steve.

434
00:28:34,417 --> 00:28:36,000
We met in '51.

435
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:41,917
If by met, you mean
I whupped your ass, then, yeah.

436
00:28:42,958 --> 00:28:45,250
We heard whispers he was on the peninsula,

437
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,625
but everyone they sent after him,
never came back.

438
00:28:51,417 --> 00:28:55,208
So the U.S. military dropped me
behind the line to go deal with him.

439
00:28:56,417 --> 00:28:59,875
I took half that metal arm
in that fight in Goyang,

440
00:28:59,958 --> 00:29:02,708
but I see he's managed to grow it back.

441
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:07,958
I just wanted to see
if he got the arm back.

442
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,500
Or if he'd come to kill me.

443
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,667
I'm not a killer anymore.

444
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:22,292
You think you can wake up one day
and decide who you wanna be?

445
00:29:23,708 --> 00:29:25,708
It doesn't work like that.

446
00:29:25,792 --> 00:29:28,708
Well, maybe it does for folks like you.

447
00:29:30,792 --> 00:29:32,417
Isaiah, the reason we're here

448
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:37,000
is because there's more
of you and me out there.

449
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:39,875
-You and me.
-And we need to know how.

450
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:42,000
I'm not gonna talk about it anymore.

You know what they did to me
for being a hero?

453

-Get out of my house!

-Sam...
-Why didn't you tell me about Isaiah?

460
00:30:27,917 --> 00:30:29,792
How could nobody bring him up?

461
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:34,708
-I asked you a question, Bucky.
-I know.

462
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:37,417
-Steve didn't know about him?
-He didn't. I didn't tell him.

463
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,250
So you're telling me
that there was a black Super Soldier

464
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:42,208

Not for that.
You missed your court-mandated therapy.

then send him off to me.

to talk to Freaky Magoo over here.

But I'm 100% fine.

It is my job
to make sure that you're okay.

And so, yeah,
this may be slightly unprofessional,

515

but it's the only way that I can see

Okay. We're going to do an exercise.

00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:18,708
It's something I use with couples

524
00:34:18,792 --> 00:34:21,042
when they are trying to figure out

525
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:23,042
what kind of life
they wanna build together.

526
00:34:23,917 --> 00:34:26,542
Are you familiar
with the miracle question?

527
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:27,958
-Absolutely not.
-Of course not.

528
00:34:28,042 --> 00:34:29,458
DR. RAYNOR: Okay, it goes like this.

529
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,500
Suppose that while you're sleeping,
a miracle occurs.

530
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,542
When you wake up,

531
00:34:35,625 --> 00:34:38,917
what is something that you would like
to see that would make your life better?

532
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,667
In my miracle, he would...
he would talk less.

533
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:45,167
Exactly what I was gonna say.
Isn't that ironic?

534
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:49,167
You guys are leaving me with no choice.
It's time for the soul-gazing exercise.

542
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:08,583
All right, good.
All right, get close.

543
00:35:09,958 --> 00:35:11,458
Come on, a little closer.

544
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,792

545
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:15,542
-Right or left?
-Why're your legs open?

546

You know what? Fine. Here.
You happy now?

547
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:19,333
-All right.
-All right.

-Good. Fine.
-We're locked in.

549

-That's a little close.
-Very. What you wanted, right?

DR. RAYNOR: Guys.

551
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:27,417
Good. Now look at each other.

552
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,417
You need to look
at each other in the eyes.

553
00:35:31,958 --> 00:35:33,875
There, you see? That wasn't so hard.

554
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:42,208

555

557
00:35:50,792 --> 00:35:55,208
All right, James,
why does Sam aggravate you?

558
00:35:55,875 --> 00:35:58,083
And don't say something childish.

559
00:36:03,667 --> 00:36:05,083
Why did you give up that shield?

560
00:36:06,917 --> 00:36:08,667
Why are you making such a big deal

561
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,292
out of something
that has nothing to do with you?

562
00:36:12,167 --> 00:36:13,458
Steve believed in you.

563
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,708
He trusted you.

564
00:36:15,792 --> 00:36:17,667
He gave you that shield for a reason.

565
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:20,917
That shield, that is...
that is everything he stood for.

566
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
That is his legacy.

567
00:36:22,083 --> 00:36:24,875
He gave you that shield,
and you threw it away like it was nothing.

568
00:36:24,958 --> 00:36:26,708
-SAM: Shut up.
-So maybe he was wrong about you.

569
00:36:26,792 --> 00:36:29,417
And if he was wrong about you,
then he was wrong about me.

570
00:36:35,792 --> 00:36:36,833
You finished?

571
00:36:38,208 --> 00:36:40,417
-Yeah.
-SAM: All right, good.

572
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:45,167
Maybe this is something you
or Steve will never understand.

573
00:36:47,167 --> 00:36:50,083
But can you accept
that I did what I thought was right?

574
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,958
(SCOFFS) You know what, Doc?
I don't have time for this.

575
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:02,583
We have some real serious shit going on.

576
00:37:02,667 --> 00:37:03,875
So how about this?

577
00:37:05,208 --> 00:37:07,500
I will squash it right now.

578
00:37:08,417 --> 00:37:11,000
We go deal with that, and when we're done,

579
00:37:11,083 --> 00:37:13,667
we both can go on separate, long vacations

580

Good to see you again.

you guys know that.

00:38:15,125 --> 00:38:16,250
So what do you got?

600
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,792
CAPTAIN AMERICA: Well,
the leader's name's Karli Morgenthau.

601
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:21,167
We've been targeting civilians

602
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:23,417
who've been helping
Karli move from place to place.

603
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,167
They geotagged a location,
then scrambled the signal.

604
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:28,583
But our satellites
have found their symbol popping up

605
00:38:28,667 --> 00:38:31,833
in various displaced communities
all across Central and Eastern Europe.

606
00:38:31,917 --> 00:38:35,000
We think she's taking the medicine
she just stole to one of these camps.

607
00:38:35,083 --> 00:38:38,167
Well, there are hundreds of those
all over the planet since The Blip.

608
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:40,125
So I guess you'll have to look real hard.

609
00:38:40,208 --> 00:38:41,917
Good thing
I have 20/20 vision, huh?

-(VOICE RISES) No, we don't know, Bucky.

It's only a matter of time
before we find out.

612
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,375
Things are really intense for you,
aren't they, Walker?

613
00:38:52,458 --> 00:38:54,250
Take it easy. Look, Walker's right.

614
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:56,833
It is imperative
that we find them and stop them.

615
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,208
But you guys have rules of engagement

you have to get.

00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:07,708
So it wouldn't make sense
for us to work with you.

620
00:39:10,167 --> 00:39:11,375
A word of advice, then.

621
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,125
Stay the hell out of my way.

Damn it! We gotta move out now.

624
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:38,208
-They found us.
-How much time do we have?

625
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:41,417
-None. It's The Power Broker's men.
-Everybody, grab what you can.

626
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:47,875
I can give you time.

627
00:39:49,917 --> 00:39:51,125
I'll hold them off.

628
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:56,542
KARLI: Thank you.

629
00:39:58,625 --> 00:40:00,750
One world. One people.

632
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,833
stop right there. Freeze!

00:40:53,292 --> 00:40:55,125
Hit him, open fire.

636
00:41:28,167 --> 00:41:29,792
So what are you thinking?

637
00:41:29,875 --> 00:41:31,542
Well, I know what we have to do.

638

When Isaiah said "my people"...

639
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,833
Oh, don't take that to heart.
That's not what he meant.

640
00:41:36,917 --> 00:41:38,167
No, he meant HYDRA.

641
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:39,875
HYDRA used to be my people.

642
00:41:40,625 --> 00:41:42,583
(SCOFFS) Not a chance.

643
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:45,958
-Walker doesn't have any leads.
-I know where you're going with this, no.

644
00:41:46,042 --> 00:41:49,333
He knows all of HYDRA's secrets.
Don't you remember Siberia?

645
00:41:49,417 --> 00:41:52,000
So you're just gonna go
sit in a room with this guy?

646
00:41:53,167 --> 00:41:54,542
(HESITATES) Yes.

647
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:00,500
Okay, then.

648
00:42:05,167 --> 00:42:06,708
We're gonna go see Zemo.
